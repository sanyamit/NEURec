This is a very basic website that serves as a prototype for our idea for the Make-a-thon Our project will target improving the disposal of waste at Devon House. Specifically, we plan to create an 
app that will help users discard rubbish in the correct bins based on a user-obtained photo and a provided list of keywords. Properly utilizing the bins ensures that, on the University’s side, 
the waste will be taken to the correct disposal center. The app will have user profiles and a point system, which will contribute to a leaderboard and prizes - potentially a discount from the 
university store or gift cards. Each correct disposal of garbage (which is approved by the developers) will have a set number of points based on the bin used. While the overall contribution to a 
user’s carbon footprint is not calculated, the user, by interacting with the app, will help improve Devon House’s overall environmental impact.
